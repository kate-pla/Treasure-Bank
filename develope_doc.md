**Libraires**
The SD.h libraray is used for the SD card Module. SD library allows me to the read the files that are in the SD card. The TMRpcm.h libraray is used for the speaker. I used the tmrpcm libraray to be able to play a file from the SD card. The ezButton.h library is for the limit switch. I used the libraray to be able to get the state of the button. In the libraray there was function that allowed me to check if the button was released or if it was pressed.
